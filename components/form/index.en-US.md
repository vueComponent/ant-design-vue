High performance Form component with data scope management. Including data collection, verification, and styles.

## When to use

- When you need to create an instance or collect information.
- When you need to validate fields in certain rules.

## Form Component

You can align the controls of a `form` using the `layout` prop：

- `horizontal`：to horizontally align the `label`s and controls of the fields. (Default)
- `vertical`：to vertically align the `label`s and controls of the fields.
- `inline`：to render form fields in one line.

## Form Item Component

A form consists of one or more form fields whose type includes input, textarea, checkbox, radio, select, tag, and more. A form field is defined using `<a-form-item />`.

### Note

#### 3.x

Since version 3.0, Form.Item no longer hijacks child elements, but automatically checks through provider/inject dependency injection. This method can improve component performance, and there is no limit to the number of child elements. The same is true for child elements. It can be a high-level component that is further encapsulated.

You can reference [Customized Form Controls](#components-form-demo-customized-form-controls)

But it also has some disadvantages:

1. If the custom component wants Form.Item to be verified and displayed, you need to inject `const {id, onFieldChange, onFieldBlur} = useFormItemContext()` and call the corresponding method.

2. A Form.Item can only collect the data of one form item. If there are multiple form items, it will cause collection confusion, for example,

```html
<a-form-item>
  <a-input name="a"></a-input>
  <a-input name="b"></a-input>
</a-form-item>
```

As above Form.Item does not know whether to collect `name="a"` or `name=`b``, you can solve this kind of problem in the following two ways:

The first is to use multiple `a-form-item`:

```html
<a-form-item>
  <a-input name="a"></a-input>
  <a-form-item><a-input name="b"></a-input></a-form-item>
</a-form-item>
```

The second way is to wrap it with a custom component and call `useFormItemContext` in the custom component, It is equivalent to merging multiple form items into one.

```html
<script>
  // custom component
  import { Form } from 'ant-desing-vue';
  export default {
    name: 'custom-name',
    setup() {
      const formItemContext = Form.useFormItemContext();
    },
  };
</script>
```

```html
<a-form-item>
  <custom-com>
    <a-input name="a"></a-input>
    <a-input name="b"></a-input>
  </custom-com>
</a-form-item>
```

Third, the component library provides an `a-form-item-rest` component, which will prevent data collection. You can put form items that do not need to be collected and verified into this component. It is the same as the first This method is very similar, but it does not generate additional dom nodes.

```html
<a-form-item>
  <a-input name="a"></a-input>
  <a-form-item-rest><a-input name="b"></a-input></a-form-item-rest>
</a-form-item>
```

#### 2.x

Form.Item hijacks the only child element and listens to the `blur` and `change` events to achieve the purpose of automatic verification, so please make sure that the form field is not wrapped by other elements. If there are multiple child elements, only the change of the first child element will be monitored.

If the form field to be monitored does not meet the conditions of automatic monitoring, you can associate the form field as follows:

```html
<a-form-item name="form.name" ref="name" :autoLink="false">
  <a-input v-model:value="other" />
  <span>hahha</span>
  <div>
    <a-input
      v-model:value="form.name"
      @blur="() => {$refs.name.onFieldBlur()}"
      @change="() => {$refs.name.onFieldChange()}"
    />
  </div>
</a-form-item>
```

### Validation Rules

| Property | Description | Type | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| trigger | When to validate the value of children node. | 'blur' \| 'change' \| `['change', 'blur']` | - |
| enum | validate a value from a list of possible values | string | - |
| len | validate an exact length of a field | number | - |
| max | validate a max length of a field | number | - |
| message | validation error message | string | - |
| min | validate a min length of a field | number | - |
| pattern | validate from a regular expression | RegExp | - |
| required | indicates whether field is required | boolean | `false` |
| transform | transform a value before validation | function(value) => transformedValue:any | - |
| type | built-in validation type, [available options](https://github.com/yiminghe/async-validator#type) | string | 'string' |
| validator | custom validate function (Note: [callback must be called](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/5155)) | function(rule, value, callback) | - |
| whitespace | treat required fields that only contain whitespace as errors | boolean | `false` |

### useForm (v2.2)

`useForm` is a method that can run independently of the Form component. It uses the Vue response mechanism to monitor and verify data, and returns the verification result. You can bind the verification result to any component, `Form. Item` only displays the results.

The following versions need to be provided separately by `@ant-design-vue/use` library, it is not recommended to continue to use, you should upgrade to version 2.2+ as soon as possible

```ts
import { Form } from 'ant-design-vue';
const useForm = Form.useForm;

useForm(modelRef, ruleRef, [options]);
```

参数说明：

```ts
/*
 modelRef`, `ruleRef` must be responsive data
*/

interface Props {
  [key: string]: any;
}
function useForm(
  modelRef: Props | Ref<Props>,
  rulesRef?: Props | Ref<Props>,
  options?: {
    immediate?: boolean;
    deep?: boolean;
    validateOnRuleChange?: boolean;
    debounce?: DebounceSettings;
  },
): {
  modelRef: Props | Ref<Props>;
  rulesRef: Props | Ref<Props>;
  initialModel: Props;
  validateInfos: validateInfos;
  resetFields: (newValues?: Props) => void;
  validate: <T = any>(names?: namesType, option?: validateOptions) => Promise<T>;
  validateField: (
    name?: string,
    value?: any,
    rules?: [Record<string, unknown>],
    option?: validateOptions,
  ) => Promise<RuleError[]>;
  mergeValidateInfo: (items: ValidateInfo | ValidateInfo[]) => ValidateInfo;
  clearValidate: (names?: namesType) => void;
};
```
