Modal dialogs.

## When To Use

When requiring users to interact with the application, but without jumping to a new page and interrupting the user's workflow, you can use `Modal` to create a new floating layer over the current page to get user feedback or display information. Additionally, if you need show a simple confirmation dialog, you can use `antd.Modal.confirm()`, and so on.

### Modal.method()

There are five ways to display the information based on the content's nature:

- `Modal.info`
- `Modal.success`
- `Modal.error`
- `Modal.warning`
- `Modal.confirm`

The items listed above are all functions, expecting a settings object as parameter. The properties of the object are follows:

| Property | Description | Type | Default | Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| appContext | The context of the pop-up window is generally used to obtain content such as global registered components, vuex, etc. | - | - |  |
| autoFocusButton | Specify which button to autofocus | `null` \| `ok` \| `cancel` | `ok` |  |
| cancelButtonProps | The cancel button props | [ButtonProps](/components/button) | - |  |
| cancelText | Text of the Cancel button | string | `Cancel` |  |
| centered | Centered Modal | boolean | `false` |  |
| class | class of container | string | - |  |
| closable | Whether a close (x) button is visible on top right of the modal dialog or not | boolean | `false` |  |
| content | Content | string\|VNode \|function(h) | - |  |
| footer | Footer content, set as `footer: null` when you don't need default buttons | string\|VNode \|function(h) | - | 4.0.0 |
| icon | custom icon (`Added in 1.14.0`) | VNode \|()=>VNode | - |  |
| keyboard | Whether support press esc to close | boolean | true |  |
| mask | Whether show mask or not. | boolean | true |  |
| maskClosable | Whether to close the modal dialog when the mask (area outside the modal) is clicked | boolean | `false` |  |
| okButtonProps | The ok button props | [ButtonProps](/components/button) | - |  |
| okText | Text of the OK button | string | `OK` |  |
| okType | Button `type` of the OK button | string | `primary` |  |
| title | Title | string\|VNode \|function(h) | - |  |
| width | Width of the modal dialog | string\|number | 416 |  |
| wrapClassName | The class name of the container of the modal dialog | string | - | 3.2.3 |
| zIndex | The `z-index` of the Modal | number | 1000 |  |
| onCancel | Specify a function that will be called when the user clicks the Cancel button. The parameter of this function is a function whose execution should include closing the dialog. You can also just return a promise and when the promise is resolved, the modal dialog will also be closed | function | - |  |
| onOk | Specify a function that will be called when the user clicks the OK button. The parameter of this function is a function whose execution should include closing the dialog. You can also just return a promise and when the promise is resolved, the modal dialog will also be closed | function | - |  |

All the `Modal.method`s will return a reference, and then we can update and close the modal dialog by the reference.

```jsx
const modal = Modal.info();

modal.update({
  title: 'Updated title',
  content: 'Updated content',
});

modal.destroy();
```

- `Modal.destroyAll`

`Modal.destroyAll()` could destroy all confirmation modal dialogs(Modal.info/Modal.success/Modal.error/Modal.warning/Modal.confirm). Usually, you can use it in router change event to destroy confirm modal dialog automatically without use modal reference to close( it's too complex to use for all modal dialogs)

```jsx
const router = new VueRouter({ ... })

// router change
router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  Modal.destroyAll();
})
```

## FAQ

### Why can't the Modal method obtain global registered components, context, vuex, etc. and ConfigProvider `locale/prefixCls/theme` configuration, and can't update data responsively?

Call the Modal method directly, and the component will dynamically create a new Vue entity through `Vue.render`. Its context is not the same as the context where the current code is located, so the context information cannot be obtained.

When you need context information (for example, using a globally registered component), you can pass the current component context through the `appContext` property. When you need to keep the property responsive, you can use the function to return:

```tsx
import { getCurrentInstance } from 'vue';

const appContext = getCurrentInstance().appContext;
const title = ref('some message');
Modal.confirm({
  title: () => title.value, // the change of title will update the title in confirm synchronously
  appContext,
});
```
