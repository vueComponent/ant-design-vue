  - Deprecated `scopedSlots` `slots` custom rendering node, and replace it with `v-slot:title` to improve ease of use, avoid slot configuration expansion, and also avoid slot conflicts

- `Table`

  - Removed the `rowSelection.hideDefaultSelections` property of Table, please use `SELECTION_ALL` and `SELECTION_INVERT` in `rowSelection.selections` instead, [custom options](/components/table/#components-table-demo- row-selection-custom).
  - Removed Column slots and replaced them with `v-slot:headerCell` `v-slot:headerCell` `v-slot:bodyCell` `v-slot:customFilterDropdown` `v-slot:customFilterIcon` to improve ease of use , To avoid slot configuration expansion, but also to avoid the problem of slot conflicts

  - Added slot summary for the summary column

- `DatePicker` `TimePicker` `Calendar`

  - By default, a more lightweight dayjs is used to replace momentjs. If your project is too large and uses a lot of momentjs methods, you can refer to the document [Custom Time Library](/docs/vue/replace-date-cn), Replace with momentjs.
  - UI interaction adjustment, its antd 4.x interaction specification

- `Form` The main goal of this update is to improve performance. If you don't have custom form controls, you can almost ignore this part

  - Since version 3.0, Form.Item no longer hijacks child elements, but automatically checks through provider/inject dependency injection. This method can improve component performance, and there is no limit to the number of child elements. The same is true for child elements. It can be a high-level component that is further encapsulated.

    You can reference [Customized Form Controls](#components-form-demo-customized-form-controls)

    But it also has some disadvantages:

    1. If the custom component wants Form.Item to be verified and displayed, you need to inject `const {id, onFieldChange, onFieldBlur} = useFormItemContext()` and call the corresponding method.

    2. A Form.Item can only collect the data of one form item. If there are multiple form items, it will cause collection confusion, for example,

    ```html
    <a-form-item>
      <a-input name="a"></a-input>
      <a-input name="b"></a-input>
    </a-form-item>
    ```

    As above Form.Item does not know whether to collect `name="a"` or `name=`b``, you can solve this kind of problem in the following two ways:

    The first is to use multiple `a-form-item`:

    ```html
    <a-form-item>
      <a-input name="a"></a-input>
      <a-form-item><a-input name="b"></a-input></a-form-item>
    </a-form-item>
    ```

    The second way is to wrap it with a custom component and call `useFormItemContext` in the custom component, It is equivalent to merging multiple form items into one.

    ```html
    <script>
      // custom component
      import { Form } from 'ant-desing-vue';
      export default {
        name: 'custom-name',
        setup() {
          const formItemContext = Form.useFormItemContext();
        },
      };
    </script>
    ```

    ```html
    <a-form-item>
      <custom-com>
        <a-input name="a"></a-input>
        <a-input name="b"></a-input>
      </custom-com>
    </a-form-item>
    ```

    Third, the component library provides an `a-form-item-rest` component, which will prevent data collection. You can put form items that do not need to be collected and verified into this component. It is the same as the first This method is very similar, but it does not generate additional dom nodes.

    ```html
    <a-form-item>
      <a-input name="a"></a-input>
      <a-form-item-rest><a-input name="b"></a-input></a-form-item-rest>
    </a-form-item>
    ```

## 2.0.0-beta.2

- The color brightness of the dividing line is reduced, from `#E8E8E8` to `#F0F0F0`.
- The default background color of Table is changed from transparent to white.

### Compatibility adjustment

- The minimum supported version of Vue is Vue 3.0.

#### Adjusted API

- Removed LocaleProvider, please use `ConfigProvider` instead.
- Removed the afterClose property of Tag.
- Merged FormModel and Form, see the Form refactoring part below for details.
- `tabIndex`, `maxLength`, `readOnly`, `autoComplete`, `autoFocus` are changed to all lowercase.
- In order to use the slot more friendly in template syntax, all related to xxxRender, renderXxxx are changed to single parameter, involving `itemRender`, `renderItem`, `customRender`, `dropdownRender`, `dateCellRender`, `dateFullCellRender`, `monthCellRender`, `monthFullCellRender`, `renderTabBar`.
- All the places where scopedSlots are configured are changed to slots.
- `{ on, props, attrs, ... }` configuration is flattened, such as `{ props: {type:'xxx'}, on: {click: this.handleClick}}` changed to `{ type: 'xxx', onClick: this.handleClick }`, related fields: `okButtonProps`, `cancelButtonProps`.
- Change xxx.sync to v-model:xxx
- v-model is changed to v-model:xxx, which specifically involves components:

  - The components changed from v-model to v-model:checked are: CheckableTag, Checkbox, Switch
  - The components changed from v-model to v-model:value are: Radio, Mentions, CheckboxGroup, Rate, DatePicker
  - The components changed from v-model to v-model:visible are: Tag, Popconfirm, Popove, Tooltip, Moda, Dropdown
  - The components changed from v-model to v-model:activeKey are: Collaps, Tabs
  - The components changed from v-model to v-model:current are: Steps
  - The components changed from v-model to v-model:selectedKeys are: Menu

#### Icon Upgrade

In `ant-design-vue@1.2.0`, we introduced the svg icon ([Why use the svg icon?](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/10353)). The icon API that uses string naming cannot be loaded on demand, so the svg icon file is fully introduced, which greatly increases the size of the packaged product. In 2.0, we adjusted the icon usage API to support tree shaking, reducing the default package size by approximately 150 KB (Gzipped).

The old way of using Icon will be obsolete:

```html
<a-icon type="smile" />
<a-button icon="smile" />
```

In 2.0, an on-demand introduction method will be adopted:

```html
<template>
  <smile-outlined />
  <a-button>
    <template v-slot:icon><smile-outlined /></template>
  </a-buttom>
</template>
<script>
import SmileOutlined from'@ant-design/icons-vue/SmileOutlined';
export default {
  components: {
    SmileOutlined
  }
}
</script>
```

#### Component refactoring

In 1.x, we provide two form components, Form and FormModel. The original Form component uses v-decorator for data binding. In Vue2, we use context to force update components. However, in Vue3, due to the introduction of patchFlag, etc. Optimization method, forced refresh will destroy the performance advantage brought by patchFlag. So in version 2.0, we merged Form and FormModel, retained the use of FormModel, enriched related functions, and renamed it to Form.

Involving changes:

- Added `scrollToFirstError`, `name`, `validateTrigger` properties for Form, added `finish`, `finishFailed` events, and added `scrollToField` method.
- Form.Item adds `validateFirst`, `validateTrigger`, and discards the `prop` attribute, and replaces it with `name`.
- The nested field path uses an array. In the past version, we used. To represent the nested path (such as user.name to represent {user: {name:''} }). However, in some back-end systems, the variable name will also carry .. This causes users to need additional codes for conversion. Therefore, in the new version, nested paths are represented by arrays to avoid wrong handling behaviors (such as ['user','name']).
- validateFields no longer supports callback. validateFields will return a Promise object, so you can perform corresponding error handling through async/await or then/catch. It is no longer necessary to determine whether errors is empty:

```js
// v1
// eslint-disable-next-line no-undef,no-unused-vars
validateFields((err, value) => {
  if (!err) {
    // Do something with value
  }
});
```

Change to

```js
// v2
// eslint-disable-next-line no-undef,no-unused-vars
validateFields().then(values ​​=> {
  // Do something with value
});
```
