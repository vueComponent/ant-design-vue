1. `file` File object for the current operation.

   ```jsx
   {
      uid: 'uid',   // unique identifier, negative is recommend, to prevent interference with internal generated id
      name: 'xx.png',   // file name
      status: 'done', // options：uploading, done, error, removed
      response: '{"status": "success"}', // response from server
      linkProps: '{"download": "image"}', // additional html props of file link

## FAQ

### How do I implement upload server side?

- You can consult [jQuery-File-Upload](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki#server-side) about how to implement server side upload interface.
- There is a mock example of [express](https://github.com/react-component/upload/blob/master/server.js) in rc-upload.

### How to select albums or folders on mobile devices?

You can set `:accept="null"`

### I want to display download links.

Please set property `url` of each item in `fileList` to control content of link.

### How to use `customRequest`?

See <https://github.com/react-component/upload#customrequest>.

### Why will the `fileList` that's in control not trigger `change` `status` update when the file is not in the list?

`change` only trigger when file in the list, it will ignore left events when removed from the list. Please note that there exist bug which makes event still trigger even the file is not in the list before `3.0.0-beta.10`.

### Why does `change` sometimes return File object and other times return { originFileObj: File }?

For compatible case, we return File object when `beforeUpload` return `false`. It will merge to `{ originFileObj: File }` in next major version. Current version is compatible to get origin file by `info.file.originFileObj`. You can change this before major release.

### Why sometime Chrome can not upload?

Chrome update will also break native upload. Please restart chrome to finish the upload work. Ref:
